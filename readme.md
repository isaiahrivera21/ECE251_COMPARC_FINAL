## 32-bit CPU in MIPS 


The Von Neumann architecture is a computer architecture that is based on the concept of a single memory unit for both data and instructions. The architecture was proposed by John von Neumann, and it has been widely used in modern computers. In this write-up, we will discuss a 32-bit MIPS implementation based on the Von Neumann architecture.

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a 32-bit MIPS CPU. The objective is to create a CPU that can execute a subset of the MIPS instruction set, while adhering to the basic principles of the Von Neumann architecture.

The overall design includes several main components, such as the ALU, control unit, registers, and memory. The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations, the control unit manages the flow of data between the components, the registers store data and instructions, and the memory stores the program and data.

 The CPU is designed to fetch instructions and data from a single memory unit. The instruction set is based on a subset of the MIPS instruction set, which includes arithmetic, logical, load word /store word, branch,  and jump instructions.
